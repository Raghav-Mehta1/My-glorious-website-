<p>Hello! I’m Raghav, a student at the London Business School studying Analytics and Management (MAM). My Bachelors degree was in systems engineering, with a focus on plant communication systems as part of my dissertation, and general communications systems.
My professional background is in healthcare, working for the NHS during the Coronavirus pandemic, in a data role, as well as startup organisations.
I’m interested in breaking into a more general field, using my problem solving background in a consulting focus.</p>
